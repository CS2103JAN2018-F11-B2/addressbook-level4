== PROJECT: TuitionCor

---

== Overview

TuitionCor is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: *Morphed AddressBook - Level 4 into TuitionCor by adding support for clients in model, logic, storage*
** What it does: Extends or changes the Person related fields and commands in AddressBook to suit Clients in TuitionCor
** Justification: This changes the original AddressBook into TuitionCor and lay the foundation for future enhancements of TuitionCor.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a remove command that allows user to easily edit the the frequently edited subjects without having to re-type the entire remaining subjects.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/functional/shookshire.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-F11-B2/main/blob/master/collated/test/shookshire.md[Test code]]
