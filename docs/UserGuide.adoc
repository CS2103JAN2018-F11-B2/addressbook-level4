== Introduction

TuitionCor is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing client information*. More importantly, TuitionCor is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TuitionCor can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `TuitionCor.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your client information.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.PNG[width="790"]
+
.  By default, upon launching TuitionCor you will be shown the active client list. If you are a new user, the active client and closed list will be filled with sample students and tutors.
** Active client list contains two separate list. Clients shown here are those who looking for students or tutors here.
*** The list on the left represents the student's list where you can view information regarding students who are looking for tutors.
*** The list on the right represents the tutor's list where you can view information regarding tutors who are looking for students.
** Closed client list contains two separate list. Clients shown here are those who are no longer looking for students or tutors.
*** The list on the left represents the student's list where you can view information regarding closed students who are no longer looking for tutors.
*** The list on the right represents the tutor's list where you can view information regarding closed tutors who are no longer looking for students.
** You can easily toggle between the closed and active client's list by command word `switch`.

[NOTE]
Commands available in active client's list: +
`addclient` `clear` `close` `delete` `edit` `exit` `find` `help` `history` `list` `match` `redo` `undo` `remove` `sort` `switch`

[NOTE]
Commands available in closed client's list: +
`clear` `exit` `find` `help` `history` `list` `redo` `undo` `restore` `switch`

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`addclient`**`c/s n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 t/Urgent` l/north g/s4 s/math : adds a contact named `John Doe` to TuitionCor.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Some pointers +
Duplicates of similar students in the student's list is not allowed. Vice versa for tutor's list. However, duplicate contacts between student's and tutor's list is allowed as it's possible for a tutor to also be a student. +
+
A duplication of student or tutor happens when they do not have at least one difference in the following fields: {Name, Address, Phone Number, Email}.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features
*Breakdown of features*

*  In v1.2:
** Supports addition of client, either tutor or students.

*  In v1.3:
** All commands are working and integrated with client.
** Clients information are saved.
** New match feature which allowing matching of student to tutors or tutor to students.
** Sort feature which allows tutor's and student's list to be sorted by name, subject, location and grade.

*  In v1.4:
** Match function now includes a ranking system.
***  The ranking system works according to the number of matched attributes.
*** The matched attributes will be highlighted in orange.
** Close and restore command which allows user to close or restore a particular student or tutor .
*** This allows user to close a tutor of student upon successful matching which will be stored in a closed tutor's or student's list for future reference.
*** This also allows user to restore a client from the closed list to active list if the client were to become active again.
** Switch command.
*** Allows user to toggle between active list and closed list.
** Enhance grade, subject and location to support multiple field.
** Remove function to remove the specified subject.
*** This allows the user to remove the specified subject from the client instead of having to type out all the remaining subjects in edit. This is under the consideration that the desired subject of the student would often change as he find's a tutor.

*  In v1.5:
** Issues received in v1.4 were carefully reviewed and relevant changes were made. We thank users for your generous feedback.
*** Bugs found were fixed.
*** Find function now works normally with same grades of different format. Eg: (P2 and Primary2).
*** Find function now supports multiple grade fields.

*  Coming in v2.0:
** Auto match function.
*** Whenever a new client either student or tutor is added, a list of tutor or student who fits the criteria of the tutor or student will be displayed to the user.
** Integrate it with an online platform.
*** Whenever a user or student sign up on the online platform, their information will automatically be added into TuitionCor database.
** Automatic Close function
*** An optional feature that will automatically Close a student (storing his/her contact into backup) when the last subject has been removed.
** Automatic change of grade for students
*** Either by allowing TuitionCor to sync with the computer's clock or through manually calling the command, all student's grade will be changed eg. from p1 to p2.
** Timetable availability
*** Include a timetable into TuitionCor similar to a personal reminder app. However, this timetable would instead be used to show the availability of the student/tutor to allow for better matching.
** Auto close function.
*** This allows the application to auto delete a client from the closed list after a certain period.
*** The grace period for auto deletion can be predetermined by the user.
** Addition grade fields to be added.
*** Polytechnic and ITE.

====
*Command Format*


* There are alias for some of the commands, which helps users to save some time. e.g. for addclient command, you can use ac n/... or a n/...
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addclient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addclient n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

// tag::addclient[]
=== Adding a client: `addclient` {Since v1.2}

Adds a client to TuitionCor +
Format: `addclient c/CATEGORY n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]... l/LOCATION g/GRADE s/SUBJECT`

Alias Format: `ac c/CATEGORY n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]... l/LOCATION g/GRADE s/SUBJECT`
[TIP]
A client can have any number of tags (including 0)

[NOTE]
The type of location and grade accepted can be found below.

****
* It's required to indicate the category the particular client belongs to.
* Accepted case-insensitive location available for user input are {North,South,East,West,Central}. Any other type of location will be invalid.
* Accepted case-insensitive grade available for user input are as follows:
** Format of grade are in this particular format 'LEVEL YEAR' or alias format 'ALIASLEVEL YEAR' without any spacing in-between. Example: 'Primary1' or 'P1'.
** LEVEL available are {Kindergarten, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, University}. Alias LEVEL are {K,P,S,J,U} respectively.
** INDEX available varies differently for each Level.
*** For Kindergarten INDEX available are {1,2,3}.
*** For Primary INDEX available are {1,2,3,4,5,6}.
*** For Secondary INDEX available are {1,2,3,4,5}.
*** For Tertiary INDEX available are {1,2}.
*** For University INDEX available are {1,2,3,4}
* Subject are split based on black space. Hence a single subject has to be typed without any space.
** Example: "chinese studies" would be treated as two separate subject "chinese" and "studies" by other commands. Hence it should be typed without a blank space such as "chineseStudies".
